# roster-log-viewer

Standalone web app for viewing roster logs.

This is fundamentally just a file browser: given a path to a root directory,
allows users to browse and view any files in the tree.

Roster log files have special rendering treatment, such as colored highlighting
and severity filters.

See `/docs` for development and deployment notes.
